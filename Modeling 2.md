# Modelling 2

In the last docs we learned about simulation and why it's important, took a quick look on gazebo and how do we deal with it, learned about sdf and it's different tags and finally created our own robot from scratch. In this file we will continue our journey in modelling, so let's start by listing the goals that we want to achieve by the end of this file:

1. Moving robot.
3. World design.
4. Adding sensors
5. GZ Sim topics.
6. ROS2 bridge.

Quick recap of the previous docs we have created a robot with a cylinderical chassis, two revolute wheels and one caster wheel on bottom front of the robot. We have added all the joints for those links and conneced everything together. Now let's start moving this robot around.
